# style-meter README

style-meter is a VSCode extension that adds a Devil May Cry-like style meter. This style meter is not nearly as complex as those found in character action games: typing improves your rank, and style degrades over time.

Heavily inspired by "activate power mode".

## Known Issues

- The style meter and ranking do not follow horizontal scrolling.
